This project is a basic survey form for a hypothetical "Cat Photo App". It's designed to collect feedback about user preferences, demographics, and feature suggestions. The form includes input fields for text, email, numbers, a dropdown selection, radio buttons, checkboxes, and a text area for comments. It's built using HTML and CSS and is structured with semantic elements for accessibility.
